Part I

rails - The Rails gem could be used to build an app or a website that involves a database. The benefit of Rails is its efficiency and the ability to make changes quickly.

nokogiri - I want to build a blog that looks like designlovefest.com. I can use the nokogiri gem to read the raw HTML and get scraping!

facebook - I want to allow visitors of my site to be able connect to facebook and  to post to facebook, using the Koala gem, I can access all of Facebook's API's.

twitter - I want to stay on top of all things knitting and rather than troll through twitter everyday, I'd like to pull all tweets from my favorite knitters and those containing certain hashtags once a day. I can use the twitter gem to do that.
